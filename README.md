This repository contains my solutions for the problem sets and projects of the [Harvard CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/). CS50 is an introductory computer science course that covers a wide range of topics including:

- **C programming**: A foundational language for systems programming, algorithms, and data structures.

- **Python programming**: A high-level language used for scripting, data analysis, and web development.

- **SQL databases**: A method for managing data and building applications that rely on structured data.

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: The building blocks of the web, used to create and style web pages and build interactive user interfaces.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different problem set or project. The folders contain my solutions as well as any necessary files or resources.
